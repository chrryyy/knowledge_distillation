```evaluation.py``` contains the implementation of each evaluation function.

## Folders:
```dataset``` contains data files from MorphoMNIST.

```figures``` is the automated save location for figures output from ```main.py```.

```models``` is the automated save location for model instances output by ```model_creation.py```.

```output_logs``` is the automated save location for system outputs after running ```main.py``` or ```model_creation.py```.
